# Frequent_Pattern_and_Graph_Mining_for_Classification
- Compared runtimes of Apriori and FP-tree algorithms for frequent itemset mining, varying support thresholds
- Implemented and evaluated gSpan, FSG, and Gaston algorithms for efficient frequent subgraph mining
- Engineered a pipeline for discriminative subgraph identification and binary feature extraction for classification
